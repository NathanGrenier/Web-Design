		The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so
		that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes
		and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
	</p>

	<p id="second" class="regular">
		A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But
		it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can
		be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a
		scripting language such as JavaScript.
	</p>

	<p id="third" class="regular">
		The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion
		of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their component parts (e.g. elements). Every element in a
		documentâ€”the document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table
		cellsâ€”is part of the document object model for that document, so they can all be accessed and manipulated
		using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript.
